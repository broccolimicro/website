<p>Today marks the completion of the second module of our Introduction to Self
Timed Circuits course. This module covers templated synthesis, a method for
thinking about and implementing Quasi-Delay Insensitive logic by hand. The next
module will cover formal synthesis using the <a href="https://github.com/nbingham1/haystack">Haystack</a>
toolset. All of the lectures have been recorded and made publicly available at
