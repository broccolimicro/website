<p>We have just completed the first module of our Introduction to Self Timed
Circuits course. This module covers fundamental concepts including pipeline
structures, failure modes, timing assumptions, programmatic representations at
different levels of abstraction, and data encoding. Each lecture includes a
walkthrough, working with real circuits in the <a href="https://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php">ACT language</a> with <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/cmos/">Skywater's 130nm process technology node</a>. All of the lectures have been recorded and
made publicly available at <a href="https://broccolimicro.io/courses.py">https://broccolimicro.io/courses.py</a>.</p>
