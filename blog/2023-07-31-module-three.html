<p>We have just completed the third module of our Introduction to Self Timed
Circuits course. This module covers formal synthesis, a potentially automatable
method for implementing Quasi-Delay Insensitive logic. The next module will
cover a variety of advanced topics that integrate everything from the first
three modules. All of the lectures have been recorded and made publicly
available at <a href="https://broccolimicro.io/courses.py">https://broccolimicro.io/courses.py</a>.</p>
