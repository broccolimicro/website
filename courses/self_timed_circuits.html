<h1>Self Timed Circuits Course</h1>
<address>Lecturer: Ned Bingham</address>
<time>May 15, 2023 to August 16, 2023</time>
</div>

<p>This course will cover the fundamentals of self-timed circuits including timing assumptions and guarantees, failure modes, pipeline structures, data encodings, conditional logic, internal memory, and non-deterministic behavior, hardware description languages for different layers of abstraction, and two design methodologies. It is designed with a bottom up approach, starting with circuitry and working its way up through more abstract representations. Background experience with programming is required, and circuit design is helpful but optional. The course is offered for free with the goal of building local expertise and community in VLSI, Computer Architecture, and Self-Timed Circuits.</p>

<p>There will be 24 sessions over 12 weeks, each session involves roughly 30 minutes of lecture and 30 minutes of exercises. A full toolset will be provided in the form of a docker container for Linux, facilitating both digital and analog simulation. Each session will be recorded and made available within 24 hours.</p>
