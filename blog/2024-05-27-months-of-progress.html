<p>Today we have a few updates. Since our last post, we have developed an
automated cell layout engine called Floret. It is targeted at <a
href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/cmos/">Skywater's 130nm process
technology node</a> and produces mostly DRC clean layouts. Further, we have
deployed an updated website that makes our whitepaper accessible and puts our
EDA tooling work front and center. Finally, we have have prepared to offer our
self-timed circuit course again this summer and posted it on our main page.
Over the next few weeks, we will be preparing Haystack and Floret for further
development, then we start diving into circuit design!</p>
