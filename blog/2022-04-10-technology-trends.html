<h1>Optimize for Energy</h1>

<p>The concepts introduced by Von Neumann in 1945 <a href="#neumann1945"></a>,
remain the centerpiece of computer architectures to this day. His programmable
model for general purpose compute combined with a relentless march toward
increasingly efficient devices cultivated significant long-term advancement in
the performance and power-efficiency of general-purpose computers. For a long
time, chip area was the limiting factor and raw instruction throughput was the
goal, leaving energy largely ignored. However, technology scaling has
demonstrated diminishing returns, and the technology landscape has shifted
quite a bit over the last 15 years.</p>

<p>Around 2007, three things happened. First, Apple released the iPhone opening
a new industry for mobile devices with limited access to power. Second, chips
produced with technology nodes following Intel's 90nm process ceased scaling
frequency (<a href="#b2022-04-10-intel-frequency"></a>) as the power density collided
with the limitations of air-cooling (<a href="#b2022-04-10-intel-power"></a>). For the
first time in the industry, a chip could not possibly run all transistors at
full throughput without exceeding the thermal limits imposed by standard
cooling technology. By 2011, up to 80% of transistors had to remain off at any
given time <a href="#esmaeilzadeh2011"></a>.</p>

><figcaption>History of the power density in Intel's processors. Frequency, Thermal
Design Point (<abbr title="Thermal Design Point">TDP</abbr>), and Die Area were
scraped for all Intel processors. Frequency and <abbr title="Thermal Design
Point">TDP</abbr>/Die Area were then averaged over all processors in each
technology. Switching Energy was roughly estimated from <a
href="#doyle2002"></a> and <a href="#bohr2012"></a> and combined with Frequency
and Die Area to compute Power Density.</figcaption

<p>Third, the growth in wire delay relative to frequency introduced new
difficulties in clock distribution. Specifically, around the introduction of
the 90nm process, global wire delay was just long enough relative to the clock
period to prevent reliable distribution across the whole chip (<a
href="#b2022-04-10-wire-delay"></a>).</p>

roughly estimated from <a href="#bohr2012"></a> and <a

<p>As a result of these factors, the throughput of <i>sequential</i> programs
stopped scaling after 2005 (<a href="#b2022-04-10-specint"></a>). The industry adapted,
turning its focus toward <i>parallelism</i>. In 2006, Intel's Spec Benchmark
scores jump by a 135% with the transtion from NetBurst to the Core
microarchitecture, dropping the base clock speed to optimize energy and
doubling the width of the issue queue from two to four, targeting Instruction
Level Parallelism (<abbr title="Instruction Level Parallelism">ILP</abbr>)
instead of raw execution speed of sequential operations <a
href="#intelpress2006"></a>. Afterward, performance grows steadily as
architectures continue to optimize for <abbr title="Instruction Level Parallelism">ILP</abbr>. While Spec2000 focused on
sequential tasks, Spec2006 introduced more parallel tasks <a
href="#packirisamy2009"></a>.</p>

><figcaption>History of SpecINT base mean, with benchmarks scaled appropriately <a href="#specBench"></a>.</figcaption

<p>By 2012, Intel had pushed most other competitors out of the Desktop <abbr
title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> market, and chips following Intel's
32nm process ceased scaling total transistor counts. While smaller feature
sizes supported higher transistor density, it also brought higher defect
density (<a href="#b2022-04-10-intel-defect"></a>) causing yield losses that make
larger chips significantly more expensive (<a
href="#b2022-04-10-intel-transistor"></a>).</p>

<p>Today, energy has superceded area as the limiting factor and architects must
balance throughput against energy per operation. Furthermore, improvements in
parallel programs have slowed due to a combination of factors (<a
href="#b2022-04-10-specint"></a>). First, all available parallelism has already been
exploited for many applications. Second, limitations in power density and
device counts have put an upper bound on the amount of computations that can be
performed at any given time. And third, memory bandwidth has lagged behind
compute throughput, introducing a bottleneck that limits the amount of data
that can be communicated at any given time (<a href="#b2022-04-10-memory"></a>) <a href="#mccalpin1991"></a>.</p>
