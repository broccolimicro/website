<p>We are preparing for the alpha release of a toolset for asynchronous circuit
design. Our previously named Haystack has been renamed to Loom. Loom now
integrates the Floret flow as well, and we're in the process of tying the two
flows together to allow for end-to-end synthesis. We have pivoted our full
attention to Loom with the end goal of making the final chip design much
easier. Tooling really makes all the difference. All of this comes with a
website redesign putting that alpha release front and center.</p>
