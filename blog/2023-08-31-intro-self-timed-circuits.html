<p>We have completed our Introduction to Self Timed Circuits course. There are
24 lectures split into 4 modules: Fundamentals, Templated Synthesis, Formal
Synthesis, and Advanced Topics. Each lecture includes a walkthrough, working
with real circuits in the <a href="https://avlsi.csl.yale.edu/act/doku.php">ACT
language</a> with <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/cmos/">Skywater's
130nm process technology node</a>. All of the lectures have been recorded and
made publicly available in our <a href="https://broccolimicro.io/courses.py">Courses</a> page.</p>
